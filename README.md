# Grade Statistics in C++

Hello! This is a beginner-friendly C++ program that allows a user to enter multiple class grades and outputs a summary including:

- Average percentage  
- Number of passing grades (â‰¥ 50%)  
- Their highest and lowest grades  
- Corresponding class names for best and worst grades  

The program uses loops, conditionals, functions, and string handling.
